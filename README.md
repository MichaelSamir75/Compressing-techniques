# Compression Techniques: Huffman, Arithmetic, and LZW

This project implements three popular compression algorithms: Huffman, Arithmetic, and LZW. These algorithms are widely used in various applications to reduce the size of data for efficient storage and transmission.

## Features

- **Huffman Compression**
  - Binary tree-based compression technique
  - Variable-length code generation based on frequency of characters

- **Arithmetic Compression**
  - Probability-based encoding method
  - Produces near-optimal compression ratios for small sets of data

- **LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) Compression**
  - Dictionary-based compression algorithm
  - Efficient for compressing text and binary data
